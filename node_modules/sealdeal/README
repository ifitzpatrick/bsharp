sealdeal is a set of tools for streamlining your front end build process.

Current features include automatic js/css concatenation, pre-processing
assets, shared layout files for html pages and a test server.

Future plans:
  minification
  plugin system to add other compilers/preprocessors/templating languages
  documentation
  better support for project templates
